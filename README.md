# Project Plan: Multi-Robot Coordination GUI Using Qt, ROS2, and Gazebo (3 Weeks)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a simplified Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Qt that integrates with ROS2, Gazebo, and basic hardware for multi-robot coordination. The GUI will focus on essential features such as battery monitoring, CPU load tracking, and a kill switch for emergency robot shutdown. The project will use simulation (via Gazebo) and basic hardware components (if time permits). Given the 3-week deadline, we will focus on core functionality, rapid iteration, and optimization for both simulation and real-world testing.

## Key Features
1. **Battery Monitoring**:
   - Display real-time battery charge level and alerts for low battery.
   - Visualize battery metrics (charge, voltage) from both simulation and hardware (if available).

2. **Kill Switch**:
   - Implement a kill switch for emergency shutdown of individual robots.
   - Global kill switch for immediate shutdown of all robots in case of a critical failure.

3. **System Health Monitoring**:
   - Track and display CPU load for each robot.
   - Monitor basic hardware metrics such as motor temperature (simulated or real).

4. **Multi-Robot Coordination**:
   - Support basic multi-robot monitoring in Gazebo simulation.
   - Display essential data for multiple robots (e.g., battery, CPU load).

5. **Pose and Localization (Optional)**:
   - Visualize robot positions and movement in a Gazebo simulation (if time allows).

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
1. **Team Lead**:
   - Coordinate the teamâ€™s tasks and ensure the project meets the 3-week deadline.
   - Oversee integration between GUI, ROS2 nodes, and Gazebo simulation.

2. **GUI Developer**:
   - Design and implement a simplified Qt-based interface with a focus on core functionality.
   - Ensure key widgets for battery monitoring and kill switches are operational.

3. **ROS2 Integration Specialist**:
   - Develop ROS2 nodes to communicate with the GUI for battery, CPU load, and kill switch.
   - Ensure real-time data flow between ROS2, the GUI, and the Gazebo simulation.

4. **Simulation Engineer**:
   - Set up a basic Gazebo simulation environment for testing multiple robots.
   - Ensure simulated robots provide data (battery, CPU load) for GUI testing.

5. **Hardware Developer (Optional)**:
   - Interface basic hardware sensors (e.g., battery) with ROS2 for real-time data (if time permits).
   - Focus on minimal hardware integration to ensure data flows to the GUI.

## Development Timeline

### Week 1: Setup and Core Functionality
- **Requirements**: Identify key monitoring features and set up the development environment.
- **GUI Design**: Create a simple layout for battery monitoring and kill switch.
- **ROS2 Nodes**: Develop ROS2 nodes for battery and CPU load data collection.
- **Simulated Testing**: Start with simulated data from Gazebo for GUI testing.

### Week 2: Core Integration and Feature Expansion
- **Simulation**: Implement Gazebo simulation for multiple robots.
- **Kill Switch**: Develop and test the kill switch for both simulated robots and hardware (if available).
- **System Health Monitoring**: Add CPU load and motor temperature monitoring.

### Week 3: Final Testing, Optimization, and Documentation
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough end-to-end testing with Gazebo and hardware (if possible).
- **GUI Optimization**: Focus on performance improvements and interface usability.
- **Documentation**: Write clear user manuals and project documentation for handover.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Real-Time Communication**: Ensure minimal latency between hardware/simulation and the GUI.
- **Scope Management**: Focus on core features given the 3-week timeframe; additional features will be added if time allows.
- **Simulation vs. Reality**: Ensure consistency between the Gazebo simulation and real hardware testing.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Qt**: For building the user-friendly GUI.
- **ROS2**: For handling communication between the hardware, Gazebo, and the GUI.
- **Gazebo**: For simulating robots and providing test data.
- **Hardware (Optional)**: Limited hardware integration if time permits, focusing on batteries and basic sensors.
