# Project Plan: Multi-Robot Coordination GUI Using Qt, ROS2, and Gazebo (3 Weeks)

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Qt that integrates with ROS2 and Gazebo for monitoring and controlling TurtleBot 3 robots in simulation. The focus will be on visualizing key topics like odometry, LiDAR scans, and camera feed. The GUI will also include an emergency kill switch to stop the robots. Given the 3-week timeline, the project will focus on essential functionality for multi-robot coordination in simulation.

## Key Features
1. **Odometry Visualization**:
   - Display real-time odometry data for each TurtleBot (position, orientation, velocity).
   - Visualize robot movement on a 2D map.

2. **LiDAR Scan (Laser Scan) Visualization**:
   - Display LiDAR scan data from TurtleBot 3 in real-time.
   - Visualize detected obstacles and surroundings.

3. **Camera Feed**:
   - Stream the camera feed from the TurtleBot’s onboard camera.
   - Display real-time video in the GUI.

4. **Kill Switch**:
   - Implement a kill switch to stop individual or all robots in an emergency.
   - Display the status (active/inactive) of each robot.

5. **Multi-Robot Monitoring**:
   - Support real-time data visualization for multiple TurtleBot 3 robots in simulation.
   - Display essential data (odometry, scan, camera) for each robot.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
1. **Team Lead**:
   - Coordinate tasks and ensure the project meets the 3-week deadline.
   - Oversee the integration of ROS2 topics with the GUI and simulation.

2. **GUI Developer**:
   - Design and implement the Qt-based interface for odometry, LiDAR, and camera visualization.
   - Ensure the kill switch feature is integrated and operational.

3. **ROS2 Integration Specialist**:
   - Develop ROS2 nodes to subscribe to topics like `/odom`, `/scan`, and `/camera/rgb/image_raw`.
   - Ensure real-time data flow between ROS2 and the GUI.

4. **Simulation Engineer**:
   - Set up and configure TurtleBot 3 in the Gazebo simulation.
   - Ensure the simulation environment provides accurate data for the GUI.

5. **System Tester**:
   - Test the end-to-end functionality of the GUI with the Gazebo simulation.
   - Debug any integration issues between ROS2, Gazebo, and the GUI.

## Development Timeline

### Week 1: Setup and Core Functionality
- **Requirements**: Identify key topics (odometry, LiDAR, camera) to be visualized.
- **Environment Setup**: Set up ROS2, Qt, and Gazebo with TurtleBot 3 in simulation.
- **GUI Design**: Create a basic interface layout for odometry, LiDAR, and camera visualization.
- **ROS2 Nodes**: Develop basic ROS2 nodes to subscribe to `/odom`, `/scan`, and `/camera/rgb/image_raw`.

### Week 2: Core Feature Integration
- **Odometry Visualization**: Implement real-time odometry data visualization in the GUI.
- **LiDAR Scan Visualization**: Display real-time LiDAR scan data and obstacle detection.
- **Camera Feed**: Stream and display the TurtleBot’s camera feed in the GUI.
- **Multi-Robot Setup**: Test the GUI with multiple TurtleBot 3 robots in Gazebo.

### Week 3: Final Testing, Optimization, and Documentation
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough end-to-end testing with the Gazebo simulation.
- **Kill Switch**: Implement and test the kill switch for emergency stop functionality.
- **GUI Optimization**: Ensure the GUI runs smoothly and handles multiple robots.
- **Documentation**: Write clear instructions and documentation for the system.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **Real-Time Communication**: Ensure low-latency data visualization for odometry, LiDAR, and camera topics.
- **Multi-Robot Coordination**: Make sure the GUI can handle and display data from multiple robots in the simulation environment.
- **Simulation Consistency**: Ensure data consistency between Gazebo and the GUI visualization.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Qt**: For building the cross-platform GUI.
- **ROS2**: For handling communication between the simulation and the GUI.
- **Gazebo**: For simulating TurtleBot 3 robots and generating data for visualization.
